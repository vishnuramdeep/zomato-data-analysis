As part of a data analysis project, I utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly to extract insights from the Zomato Bangalore dataset. One of the main objectives was to calculate the average rating of each restaurant and determine the rating distribution. I found that most of the restaurants fell in the 3 to 4 out of 5 rating range. Additionally, I identified the top restaurant chains in Bangalore and discovered that Cafe Coffee Day was the top chain.

Another key finding was related to online orders and table bookings. I determined that 65% of restaurants in Bangalore accept online orders, while only 15% accept table bookings. Furthermore, I analyzed the types of restaurants that were most popular in Bangalore and found that quick bite restaurants such as Vidyarthi Bhavan and CTR were highly preferred.

I also looked at the geographical distribution of restaurants in Bangalore and found that Jalahalli had the highest number of restaurants in the city. Interestingly, even though Bangalore is in South India, the number of restaurants offering North Indian cuisine was higher than those offering South Indian cuisine. Moreover, North Indian cuisine accounted for 73% of total restaurants in Bangalore, while South Indian cuisine accounted for only 23%.

In addition to the above findings, I also analyzed the relation between views, likes, and dislikes of the restaurants. I found that restaurants that accept online orders tend to receive more votes from customers compared to those that do not accept online orders. This can be a useful insight for restaurant owners who are looking to improve their customer engagement.

Furthermore, I identified the costliest and most affordable restaurants in Bangalore. The costliest restaurant for two people was Le Cirque Signature - The Leela Palace, which cost around 6000rs. On the other hand, Srinidhi Sagar Food Line was the most affordable restaurant.

Finally, I performed a geographical analysis using the Geopy and Folium modules and visualized the results with a heatmap. This analysis provided a visual representation of the distribution of restaurants in Bangalore.

Overall, this project demonstrated my proficiency in data analysis using Python and various data analysis tools. The insights I uncovered can be useful for restaurant owners and customers alike, and I am confident that my skills and experience can add value to any data-driven organization.
